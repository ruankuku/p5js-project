**Project Description**

This is an interactive generative art project that explores our unconscious awareness of how our body organs function. Through dynamic imagery and user interaction, the goal is to highlight the often-overlooked processes that keep us alive.

·How It Was Made 

The project was built using p5.js for canvas creation, image manipulation, and interactivity. Some organ illustrations were created with an AI drawing tool, while the background was designed in Photoshop.
Key coding concepts include:
Mosaic Effect: A custom createMosaic function generates pixelated versions of images by calculating average colors for blocks of pixels.

Dynamic Behavior: Each image starts in a random position, falling with simulated gravity. When dragged upward by the user, the image shifts from blurred to clear.

User Interaction: Users can click and drag images. When an image reaches a certain height, it "unlocks" and becomes sharp, representing attention and recognition.

During development, I first learned and implemented the mosaic function, then gradually added features like falling motion and mouse interactions. Through continuous testing and debugging, I ensured responsive interactions. ChatGPT also helped fix some errors, allowing the program to run smoothly.

·Why I Made It

The body’s functions—heartbeat, breathing, digestion—are fundamental yet often overlooked. This project highlights these unconscious processes, using interactivity to help viewers reconnect with the inner workings of their bodies. The shift from mosaic to clarity and back reflects life’s cyclical nature, where moments of clarity are brief, while much of life remains in a quieter, blurred state.

While the project stems from philosophical reflection,  I still aimed for it to convey a sense of playfulness and even absurdity. Internal organs are both familiar and alien: they’re vital to our existence, yet their operations are so removed from our direct perception that they often feel strange. The whole experience is like a miniature, surreal urban drama where the organs are performers and the viewers are the directors.

·What I learned

I learned how to create a mosaic effect and improved my coding logic. Before, I was intimidated by large blocks of code, but this project showed me the value of breaking it into smaller, manageable functions.

**References**

When completing the mosaic code, I referenced [this code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnlAH1zDBDE) to create mosaic images and calculate the average color of specific regions. 

While creating organ illustrations with smiley faces, I utilized [this AI art website](https://www.recraft.ai/project/06b6eac7-3da3-439c-a921-e617613958ae).

I used ChatGPT to help me troubleshoot issues, such as when I initially imported PNG images, and black backgrounds appeared around them.
